# OpSystems

## Overview:

This project implements a set of tools fundamental to operating system functionality, focusing on system calls and process management. It includes a command-line tool similar to a Linux shell (Task 1) and a process monitor tool (Task 2) that displays information about processes belonging to the current user. Additionally, Task 3 extends Task 2 by adding a graphical user interface (GUI) for the process monitor tool.

## Required Dependencies:

GCC compiler for C programs 

## Compile 

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the files for compiling 

### For task1: 
```sh
gcc -o simple_shell task1/simple_shell.c
```

```sh
./simple_shell
```

### For task2 run:
```sh
gcc -o process_monitor process_monitor.c
```
```sh
